ABSTRACT: 
Smartphones, smartwatches, fitness trackers, and ad-hoc wearable
devices are being increasingly used to monitor human activities. Usually,
machine-learning-based algorithms process data acquired by their
sensors to classify human activities. The success of those algorithms
mostly depends on the availability of training (labeled) data. In this
letter we present a new smartphone accelerometer dataset designed for
activity recognition. The dataset includes 7,013 activities performed
by 30 subjects, mostly females, of ages ranging from 18 to 60 years.
Activities are divided in 17 fine grained classes grouped in two coarse
grained classes: 9 types of activities of daily living (ADL) and 8 types
of falls. The dataset, benchmarked with two different classifiers, thanks
to its unique features will be of interest to the scientific community.

DATA:

The dataset is composed of 4 data splits:

1. 15942x51 ADL data. Each set of three subsequent rows contains x,y,z accelerometer data (adl_data.mat).
2. 5097x51 FALL data. Each set of three subsequent rows contains x,y,z accelerometer data (fall_data.mat).
3. 21039x51 ADL and FALL data. Each set of three subsequent rows contains x,y,z accelerometer data (acc_data.mat).
4. 21039x51 ADL and FALL data. Each set of three subsequent rows contains x,y,z accelerometer data (two_classes_data.mat).

For each data split the corresponding labeling is contained in "x_labels.mat". First column contains the class labels (in terms of integer number), while the second column contains the human subject labels, which subject performed which action.
For each data split the corresponding action names are contained in "x_names.mat". The first column contains the action name, while the second column contains the corresponding integer number.

CODE

The code is written in Matlab and tested on a Ubuntu 14.04 machine with Matlab 2014b.
To repeat the experiments: open the matlab script "evall.m", change the variables "datapath", "splitpath" and "resultpath" in agreement with your local path. To repeat the same numbers of the paper, check if the original training/test splits are in the folder "./data/split/".

The results will be written in the folder "./data/results/"
