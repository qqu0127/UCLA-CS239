## demo8Features.py :  
* Reads in the features and labels extracted from Matlab script "featureExtractionDemo.m".
* Conduct binary classification on ADL/FALL data using SVM.

## algorithms :
* We used 7 models for training in train.py.
* We tryied to find the best parameter setting for svm&dt model in svm.py&dt.py
* In addition, we tryied hidden markov model in hmm.model. 

## featureExtractionDemo.m:
*Read from raw data from folder "./data"
*Process raw data and extract features for Python demo.
*Output the features and labels to folder "./demoFeaturesOutput"
					
## MatlabUtl:			
*Some useful Matlab helper function
