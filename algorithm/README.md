## SVM
* one Linear svm, one RBF svm
* Line 189 - 199 are used for choosing parameters for svm
* performance results are in 'svm_results/performance.txt'
* 'svm_results/param_linear.txt' shows parameter's influence on performances of linear svm.
* 'svm_results/param_rbf_*.csv' shows parameter's influence on performances of rbf svm.

## DecisionTree
* 'dt_results/dt_depth.png' shows relationship between dt's depth and error
* 'dt_results/dtree.pdf' shows the decision tree we construct
* 'dt_results/performance.txt' shows the performance of dt

## HMM
* We used Hidden Markov Model for training in hmm.py

## Other models
* we also tried random forest, knn, GBDT, logistic regression, naive bayes in train.py.
